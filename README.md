# Easy Zip Update
Contributors: [Mike Nelson](https://cmljnelson.wordpress.com)

WordPress plugin that makes updating a Plugin or Theme from a Zip file easier. Just upload using WordPress' normal plugin/theme zip uploader. (Instead of deactivating it, deleting it, THEN uploading it, and reactivating it.)

## Usage

1. Click "Clone or download" link in top-right of this GitHub page, then "Download Zip".
1. Follow [these instructions](https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/install-plugin-zip-file-wordpress/) to upload the zip file on your site and activate it.
1. Now, whenever you want to update a plugin, go to Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin, and upload the new version of the plugin, and click "Install Now", as if it were a new plugin. Normally WordPress would give an error, saying the plugin already exists, but with this plugin activated, it will instead update the plugin.
